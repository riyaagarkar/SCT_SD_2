Number Guessing Game (GUI)

This project is part of the SkillCraft Technology Internship under the Software Development track. The aim was to develop a user-driven application that enhances interactivity through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The project is a Number Guessing Game, where the program:

Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.

The user enters guesses through a text input box.

The app gives instant feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Once the correct number is guessed, a congratulatory message is displayed.


This game is developed using Python and the built-in Tkinter library, providing a clean and interactive interface for the user.



âœ… Key Objectives Achieved:

Implemented random number generation using Python.

Developed a user-friendly GUI using tkinter.

Ensured the application is user-driven, as per the internship instructions.

Added input validation and feedback system to guide the user during the guessing process.
